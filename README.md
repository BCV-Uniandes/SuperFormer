# SuperFormer: Volumetric Transformer Architectures for MRI Super-Resolution
This repository provides a Pytorch implementation of the paper SuperFormer: Volumetric Transformer Architectures for MRI Super-Resolution. Presented at the 7th [Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop](https://2022.sashimi-workshop.org/) in [MICCAI 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/). SuperFormer is a novel volumetric visual transformer for MRI Super-Resolution. Our method leverages the 3D and multi-domain information from volume and feature embeddings to reconstruct HR MRIs using a local self-attention mechanism.
